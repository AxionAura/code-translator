# Code Translator

A behavior-preserving source-code translator for **Python ↔ JavaScript ↔ TypeScript**, designed to translate whole projects — not just snippets — with explicit, honest reporting of what was translated deterministically, what was adapted semantically, what was ambiguous, and what was not supported.

**Status: design phase.** This repository currently contains the engineering blueprint (research, architecture, roadmap). Implementation has deliberately not started; see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Core principles

1. **Deterministic first.** AI is an optional resolver for ambiguous cases, never the translation engine.
2. **Never claim correctness that was not validated.** Every validation stage reports `pass / fail / skipped(reason)`.
3. **Every emitted construct carries provenance** via a decision ledger: deterministic, semantic, ambiguous, or unsupported.
4. **Local-first.** Source code never leaves the machine unless the user explicitly enables an AI provider.
5. **Zero runtime dependencies in generated output.** Translated projects are self-contained.
